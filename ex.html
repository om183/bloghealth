            exercise go hand in hand. If you thought that only dieting will burn your belly fat, you are wrong. If you
            really want to lose weight, you need to include an hour of exercise in your daily routine for targeting and
            reducing belly fat. Here, we have compiled a list of 16 exercises that can help you reduce belly fat faster

            <li>Lie down flat on a mat with your knees bent and feet on the ground. Alternatively, you can also lift
                your legs off the floor at a 90-degree angle. (See picture).</li>
            <li>Lift your hands and place them behind your head, or keep them crossed on your chest.</li>
            <li>Inhale deeply, and as you lift your upper torso off the floor, exhale.</li>
            <li>Inhale again as you get back down, and exhale as you come up.</li>
            <li>Do this for 10 times as a beginner.</li>

            <li>Bend your knees as you would do in crunches, keeping your feet on the floor.</li>
            <li>You have to lift your upper torso while performing crunches. But, in twist crunches, you have to lift
                just your right shoulder towards the left, keeping the left side of your torso on the ground.</li>
            <li>Again alternately, lift your left shoulder towards the right, keeping the right side of your torso on

            exercise. The only difference is that you need to tilt your legs to the same side simultaneously with your
            shoulders. The side crunch focuses on the muscles on your sides.</p>

        <h2>Cardio Exercises To Reduce Belly Fat:</h2>
        <p>Cardio is one of the most effective ways to burn calories and shed unwanted flab from your body. Cardio
            exercises are immensely helpful in reducing belly fat. Doing cardio on a regular basis will offer you other
            health benefits such as reduction of stress, an increase in your lung capacity, better sleep, and a sense
            of overall well-being.

            cardio exercises to reduce belly fat is walking. Surprised? Do you think it’s too simple to be effective?
            Well, then you should know that walking is a great and effective way to burn away that ugly belly fat. In
            fact, it is an excellent fat burner for your entire body. If you follow a healthy diet along with walking
            at a steady pace for 30-45 minutes for at least four to five days every week, you will witness a gradual
            decrease in your weight.
            This low-impact exercise increases your metabolism as well as your heart rate. A heightened metabolic rate
            will burn away calories at a faster pace, thus helping to eliminate the fat accumulated around your belly.
            In fact, walking decreases the risk of injuries and is considered to be a good workout for beginners.</p>

            You have to prevent your body from getting used to any fixed workout routine. Hence, you can switch
            occasionally. Try running for a change. It is an effective way to keep your heart rate up, burn calories,
            and lose belly fat.

        <p style="font-family:Comic Sans MS, cursive, sans-serif;font-size: 125%;vertical-align: middle">Doing leg
            exercises at home is probably a lot easier than you realize. You don't need a leg press machine, or a stair
            climber, or a squat bar to fire up those lower-body muscles. All you need is your bodyweight, maybe a
            chair, and the motivation to put some burn in your quads, hamstrings, glutes, calves, and inner thighs. Oh,
            and this list of 13 no-equipment leg exercises that you can do anywhere, anytime.
            It probably comes as no surprise that having strong legs can take you far. Even if you're not training for
            a race or working toward any other specific athletic goal, you need legs that are strong enough to
            literally carry you through life. Everything from walking up a flight of stairs to lifting your heavy
            laundry bag is easier when you can put some leg muscle behind it. Luckily, effective leg exercises don't
            have to be complicated, and they don't even require a gym membership. There are plenty of bodyweight leg
            exercises you can add to your workout routine to get stronger—and work toward any bigger strength and
            performance goals you may have, too.
            "Bodyweight exercises are realistic and functional, meaning that they help us strengthen our muscles that
            we use in our daily lives," Jess Sims, a NASM-certified personal trainer at the Fhitting Room and Shadowbox
            in New York City, tells SELF. "For example, when we squat, we are essentially sitting down into an
            imaginary chair, which will help improve our posture when we actually sit in a chair. When we stand up from
            a squat, we drive through our heels and brace our core—we are essentially building great habits that
            translate into our lives outside the gym."
            Bodyweight leg exercises are also valuable for learning proper form before you add weights to certain
            moves. "We shouldn’t be using weights until we’ve mastered basic lunge, hinge, and squat movements without
            weights," Sims says. Another bonus of bodyweight moves? "You have your body all the time and it’s free to
            use, so you can do exercises anywhere and at anytime!" The best leg workouts are the ones you'll actually
            do, right? So if you've got an arsenal of moves that you can literally do anywhere, there's a better chance
            you'll fit them into your routine.
            The bodyweight leg exercises below will help you build strength while also prepping your body to do more
            complex moves with weights. Give them a try, and embrace the burn.

        <p style="font-family: berlin sans fb;font-size: 110%">If you're a woman just starting out in the gym, you may be feeling intimidated. Not only is the array of
            machines overwhelming, but most gyms are replete with muscular men who look like they'll crush anything in
            their way—including you.
            <br>
            If this describes how you feel, you're not alone; many women can identify. But if you're willing to take a
            tiny step beyond your comfort barrier, you'll be on the road to some fantastic fitness progress.
            <br>
            Let's review some of the key points you need to know to design a machine workout that will get you started
            on a weightlifting regimen.</p>

        <br>
        <br>
        <p style="font-size: 150%">A) Sit on the floor with a bench behind you and a weighted barbell over your legs. Roll the bar so it’s directly over your hips and lean back so your shoulder blades rest on the bench.            </p>
       <br> <p style="font-size:150%">B) Drive through your feet, pushing up your hips (shoulders and feet supporting you). Squeezing your glutes, extend as high as possible. Hold for 5 secs then slowly lower. Do 20 reps.            </p>

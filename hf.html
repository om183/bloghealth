            <p class="sous-text">Many people want to start eating healthier and follow a more nutritious diet. When
                you're diet contains a lot of overly processed foods, high-fat foods or foods high in sugar, you
                increase your risk for a variety of chronic health conditions. On the other hand, a nutritious,
                well-balanced diet can support your immune system, healthy development, and decrease your risk for
                obesity, diabetes and high blood pressure. Make small changes to your diet over the course of a few
                weeks as opposed to many drastic changes at once, and you'll be able to sustain a healthier way of
                eating and enjoy the health benefits of a healthy diet.</p>

            <ol style="text-align:left">
                <li>It might be helpful to first think about your current<mark>diet</mark> . What's<mark>unhealthy</mark>

                <li>The <mark>best way</mark> to reach any goal is to start with one or two very small changes. Trying

                <li>Each week in your <mark>food journal</mark>, write down the change you want to work on. For

                <li>It's typically recommended to <mark>consume</mark> five to nine servings of fruits and vegetables

            <p style="font-family:Comic Sans MS, cursive, sans-serif;text-align: left">An easy way to increase your
                <mark>nutrition</mark> and eat a <strong>healthier diet</strong> is by choosing 100% whole grains.
                These<mark> foods</mark> are much better for you than refined grains.</p>
            <ol style="text-align:left">
                <li>100% whole grains have all three parts of the grain — the germ, bran and endosperm. They are less
                    processed and contain many more nutrients like fiber, protein and minerals.</li>
                <li>Refined grains are much more processed than whole grains. They are typically stripped of the bran
                    and germ so they are lower in fiber and protein. Avoid foods made with white flour — like white
                    pasta, white rice, pastries, chips and crackers.</li>
                <li>Include a few servings of whole grains each day. Measure out a 1 oz or 1/2 cup serving to help you
                    stick to appropriate portion sizes.</li>
                <li>Try whole grains like: quinoa, brown rice, whole wheat pasta, millet, farro or whole wheat bread
                    and wraps.</li>
            </ol>

            <p style="font-family:Comic Sans MS, cursive, sans-serif;text-align: left">Although fat should be monitored
                in <strong>your diet</strong>, there are a few types of fat that are particularly healthy and provide a
                variety of health benefits.</p>
            <ol style="text-align:left">
                <li>If you're trying to eat more sources of healthy fats, make sure to swap them out for unhealthy
                    fats. Do not add more fats — healthy or not — on top of a diet containing unhealthy fats.</li>
                <li>Omega 3 fats and monounsaturated fats are both great for your body. They have been shown to improve
                    cardiovascular health and improve cholesterol levels.</li>
                <li>The best sources of these healthy fats are: avocados, olive oil, olives, nuts, nut butters, canola
                    oil, chia seeds, flaxseeds and fatty fish (like salmon, tuna and mackerel). Remember, though, that
                    these may also have a high calorie count, so be moderate.</li>
                <li>Many health professionals recommended eating fatty fish at least twice a week and including a daily
                    source of other healthy fats.</li>

            <ol style="text-align:left">
                <li>Drinking adequate water every day helps your body stay hydrated. It's very important to help

                <li>It's typically recommended to consume at least eight 8-oz glasses (2 liters) of water daily.
                    However, now many health professionals recommend consuming up to 13 glasses (3 liters) daily.</li>
                <li>In addition to water, you can try flavored water, decaf unsweetened coffee and tea. These beverages
                    are no calorie and caffeine free which are the best and most hydrating fluids.</li>

            <p style="font-family:Comic Sans MS, cursive, sans-serif;text-align: left">There are certain groups of
                foods that you should limit and only eat in moderation. Added sugars are something that should

            <ol style="text-align:left">
                <li>Added sugars are added to certain foods during their processing. They offer no nutrition, only

                    obesity.</li>
                <li>Added sugars are found in a wide variety of foods. Try to limit items like: breakfast pastries,
                    cookies, cakes, ice cream, candy, and cereals.</li>
                <li>Also limit sweetened beverages. Not only are they high in added sugars and calories, many people
                    don't think to count these types of drinks as a source of calories since they don't fill you up
                    like food does. You may end up drinking more calories through these beverages.</li>
                <li>The American Heart Association recommends that women consume no more than 6 teaspoons and men
                    consume no more than 9 teaspoons of added sugar daily.</li>

                <li>You don't need to avoid all saturated fats, but do eat them in moderation. Especially foods like:
                    full fat dairy, fatty cuts of beef or pork, deli meats and other processed meats.</li>
                <li>Trans fats have been directly linked to several adverse health effects like raising bad cholesterol

                    increases your risk for developing diabetes.Try to avoid these foods as much as possible.</li>

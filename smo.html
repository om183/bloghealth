        <img src="cucumber-mint-pineapple-smoothies(v6).jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image" style="float:right;width: 40%">
      <p>I love a good <strong>detox smoothie</strong>. I’ve been drinking these delicious, <mark>Healthy</mark>
        smoothies for years and still have them at least 3-4 times a week.
        <br>
        If I’m feeling bloated and need a natural detox cleanse, I’ll replace 1 to 2 meals a day with detox smoothies
        and more often than not, I can really lose weight fast.
        <br>
        Also called <strong>weight loss smoothies</strong> or green smoothies, detox smoothies are easy to make and
        taste delicious – especially when you find ingredients you especially like.
        <br>
        If you need to lose up 5-10 pounds quickly, I encourage you to try a 3 day smoothie cleanse and see how
        effective detox smoothies for <strong>weight loss</strong> can be.</p>
      <b>Special Tip:</b>Detox smoothies are a powerful weight loss tool that you can (and should) use every day.
      <p>Detox smoothies work so effectively because they are made from fruits, veggies, seeds, nuts, herbs, and spices
        that are rich in vitamins, minerals, phytonutrients, and dietary fiber. Though drinking spinach smoothie
        doesn’t seem so palatable, the recipes listed here are absolutely delicious, takes 5 minutes to prepare, and
        pocket-friendly.</p>
      <p>Smoothies are a great tool for weight loss because you control the ingredients. They make perfect vehicles for
        relatively low-calorie, yet nutrient-laden ingredients that are capable of keeping you full for a long time.

        By combining the right ingredients, you can create smoothies that taste great and help you drop pounds. It
        doesn’t take long to learn what to use and how to make the right combinations. Just keep reading and start
        losing!</p><br>

    <img src="Smoothies-Weight-Loss.jpg" alt="Responsive image" class="img-fluid" style="height:350px;width:400px;float:right">  
    <p style="font-size:130%;text-align: left;">The reason that smoothies can help you lose weight is
      that you can get all of your necessary nutrients in one
      glass without adding in excess or empty calories. When you learn about the ingredients that create a balanced
      smoothie, you will be able to include a good balance of protein, complex carbohydrates, healthy fats, as well as
      vitamins and nutrients.
      <br><br>
      Besides the basics, you can include powerhouse ingredients that up the nutritional value of your smoothie without
      adding extra calories. You can also include elements that enhance your weight loss by boosting your metabolic
      rate, giving you more energy, and filling you up for hours.</p>

    <h3  style="text-align:left">2-Ingredients for Weight Loss:</h3>
    <p style="text-align:left;font-size:135%;text-decoration: underline">While many of the traditional ingredients in healthful
      smoothies support a healthy weight, some are better than
      others. There are certain things you can put in your smoothie that will boost your weight loss by different
      means.</p>
      <img class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image" style="height:200px;width:300px" src="avocado.jpg" >
      <img class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image" style="height:200px;width:300px" src="selection-of-berries-from-above.jpg" >
      <img class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image" style="height:200px;width:300px" src="cayennepepper-1.jpg" >
      <div style="text-align:left;font-size:130%">
      <br><b>Avocado:</b>Alligator pears are the preferred weight loss smoothie thickener, or ingredient that provides
      that
      signature smoothie creaminess. They supply ample healthy fat, which will keep you satiated and satisfied until
      your
      next meal, and an array of health promoting vitamins and minerals.
      <br><b>Berries:</b>Any kind of berry, strawberry, blueberry, blackberry, and raspberry for instance, add a ton of
      flavor to a smoothie without adding very many calories or sugar. Additionally, they are high in fiber, which
      helps
      to keep you full, and antioxidants for your overall health.
      <br><b>Cayenne pepper:</b>This spice not only adds a kick to your smoothie, it also boosts your weight loss
      capability.
      The compound responsible is called capsaicin. Research has shown that adding it to breakfast reduces consumption
      of
      fat and carbohydrates later in the day. In other words, consuming a little cayenne pepper will curb your
      appetite.<br>

      </div>
      <br><b>Chia seeds:</b>The same little seeds that make hair grow on ceramic animals are a great tool for weight
      loss.
      They are packed with fiber and protein to help keep you feeling full and satisfied and they contain numerous
      healthful nutrients like calcium, antioxidants, and omega-3 fatty acids. They are also known to absorb toxins
      from
      your digestive tract. Many of my recipes call for chia seeds or chia seed gel. I prefer the gel because it helps
      unlock the nutrition, is slightly easier to digest, and adds to the creaminess of your smoothie. To make chia
      seed
      gel, combine equal parts chia seeds and water in a small container and let sit for 5 – 10 minutes to gel. Stores
      in
      the fridge for a good month.
      <br><b>Cinnamon:</b>The popular spice helps regulate blood sugar levels by improving the metabolism of glucose.
      This
      results in a reduction of the amount of excess blood glucose that can be stored as fat. Abdominal fat, studies
      have
      shown, is more sensitive to the effects of cinnamon than fat from any other part of the body.
      <br><b>Coconut oil:</b>This is my number one smoothie weight loss ingredient. As you’ll soon read all about
      below,
      ample healthy fat in your smoothies and diet is imperative if you’re serious about losing weight, and achieving
      optimal health. The predominant fats (medium chain) in coconut oil are used by the body for energy as opposed to
      being stored as fat. This superfood keeps you satiated, energized, and feeling good. Go with an organic virgin
      coconut oil for your smoothies and internal consumption.
      <br>
      <div class="imgs">
      <img class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image" style="height:200px;width:300px" src="Banana-Bread-Greek-Yogurt-Parfait-eMeals-2-blog-1024x665.jpg" >

      </div>
      <br><b>Greek yogurt:</b>Compared to other styles of yogurt, Greek yogurt is much higher in protein. This means it
      can
      fill you up and keep you fuller longer. Opt for the full-fat variety, and stick with plain. The flavored
      varieties
      usually have a lot of added sugar.
      <br<<b>Healthy fats:</b>Healthy fats are vital to your overall health and help keep you satiated for hours.
        Totally
        denying fat is not a way to lose weight. You will only feel unsatisfied when you eat. Consuming ample healthy
        fat
        is actually an integral part of any weight loss plan. Include fats in your smoothies by adding avocado, coconut
        oil, or nuts and nut butters. If you make elixirs, butter and cream are good options too.
        <br><b>Leafy greens:</b>Greens, like kale, spinach, dandelion, and romaine lettuce, are packed with
        phytonutrients and
        low in calories. They are also high in fiber. Make sure to rotate your greens on a regular basis.
        <br><b>Pulp from fruit:</b>If you have a juicer, you know that in addition to the juice, you end up with a pile
        of
        throw-away pulp. This is all of the fiber from the fruits and instead of throwing it out or composting it, you
        can
        add it to your smoothies for a natural source of fiber.
        <br>
        <div class="imgs">

        </div>
        <br><b>Stevia:</b>If the fruit you add to your smoothies is not enough sweetness for you, consider using
        stevia. This
        natural, zero-calorie sweetener comes from a plant and is free from the side effects and possible risks of
        artificial sweeteners.
        <br><b>Tea/water/ice:</b>Many smoothie recipes call for milk or fruit juice to create the right consistency. To
        avoid
        the extra calories, substitute them with tea, water, or ice. A fruity, herbal tea is a good substitute for
        juice.
        Green tea contains healthful nutrients, including a compound thought to aid in weight loss, and it has a mild
        flavor. For a consistency more like a shake, use ice.

<div id="it">
    <h3  style="text-align:left">3-Ingredients to Avoid:</h3>
    <p style="font-size:130%;text-align: left;text-decoration: underline">There are plenty of great foods and supplements to put
      in your smoothies that will give you flavor without
      excess calories. There are also some pitfalls. Too many people assume that any smoothie is a healthy option, but
      there are some ingredients that should be avoided if you are using smoothies as a weight loss tool. The most
      important thing you want to avoid in your smoothies is excess sugar. Even “healthier” sugar from natural sources
      such as fruit, honey, and maple syrup should be minimized.</p>
    <div style="text-align:left;font-size:130%">
      <div class="imgs">

      </div>
      <b>Canned fruits or vegetables:</b> Fresh produce is always best, but when you can’t find what you want, turn to
      frozen
      foods before cans. Canned fruits and vegetables often have added preservatives or sweeteners that increase the
      amount of calories. They have also lost a significant amount of their nutritional value. Fresh and frozen veggies
      and fruits maintain nutrient content much longer than canned products.
      <br><b>Dairy:</b>Dairy products like milk, ice cream, or frozen yogurt are common ingredients in smoothies, but
      they are chock full of extra calories. There are exceptions, such as raw milk and plain, full-fat Greek yogurt,
      which is high in protein and low in sugar, but most dairy should be avoided.
      <div class="imgs">
      <img class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image" style="height:200px;width:300px" src="43684986_l_edit.jpg" >
      <img class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image" style="height:200px;width:300px" src="téléchargement (3).jpg" >
      </div>
      <br><b>Fruit juice:</b>Juice is often high in sugar and calories and low in nutritional value, especially
      store-bought products. Many contain added sweeteners, and all have lost the fiber of the whole fruit. A limited
      amount of 100 percent juice is fine, but too much will just increase your total (bad) calorie intake.
      <br><b>Some Protein powders:</b>By “some” I mean those full of fillers and suspect ingredients (list of
      ingredients is a long list of hard to pronounce words), which don’t support healthy weight loss. A clean protein
      powder is perfectly acceptable. Don’t feel like you have to use a protein powder though as there are many healthy
      whole food sources of protein such as nuts, nut butters, seeds, Greek yogurt, and gelatin. If you’re not sure if
      a protein powder is right for you, give one a try and see how you respond. If you’re wondering, I recommend Sun
      Warrior protein and these other clean protein powders.

      </div>
      <br><b>Sweeteners:</b>If your smoothie tastes very sweet, you are probably over doing it on the sweetener and
      potentially consuming too much sugar for a weight loss plan. Stevia is a natural, no-calories sweetener that you
      can use. Other good sweeteners, such as honey and maple syrup should be used in moderation.
      <br><b>Too much sweet fruit:</b>Whole, fresh fruits are good for you, and a natural way to add flavor and a
      little sweetness to your smoothie, but too much can be a problem. A lot of fruit in one smoothie can spike your
      blood sugar and cause digestive problems. A good rule of thumb is to stick to avocados and berries. Small amounts
      of sweeter fruits such as banana, apple, mango, and pineapple is fine, but keep those to a minimum. Smoothies
      high in sugar are a recipe for weight gain.

    <h3  style="text-align:left">4-Smoothie Diet:</h3><img src="20-recettes-de-smoothies-pour-faire-le-plein-d-energie.jpg"
      alt="Responsive image" class="img-fluid" style="float:right;width:40%">
    <p style="font-size:130%;text-align: left;"> Smoothie diets have become quite popular. I want to
      make it clear that I’m not an advocate of smoothie diets. I recommend a smoothie for breakfast and two regular
      meals for lunch and dinner. Substituting a smoothie for another meal once in a while or having one after working
      out is perfectly acceptable. Note, most people enjoy smoothies for breakfast. Having your one smoothie for the
      day at lunch or dinner is absolutely fine.
      <br>
      I’m not a fan of smoothie diets, or detox diets, because they’re often undertaken as a quick fix. These diets
      usually involve severely restricting calories, which is not easy and can actually cause you harm. You may lose
      weight on a smoothie or detox diet, but it’s usually temporary. In the long run you end of gaining the weight you
      lost back and then some. This yo-yo dieting is not something you want to get caught up in.
      <br>
      I recommend a “real” diet. One based on traditional foods, those that our great grandparents consumed, and in
      many cases our species has consumed for hundreds and even thousands of years. This diet is based on the work of
      Weston A. Price and what I personally consume and advocate.
      <br>After experimenting with vegetarianism and veganism I found these dietary guidelines work best for me and
      have been following them since late 2010. We are unique individuals with unique dietary requirements. There’s not
      one perfect diet that everyone should be on. I recommend experimenting and paying close attention to your body
      and how you feel to arrive at what diet most resonates with you.</p>

    <div style="font-size:135%;">
      It may be hard for most of us to imagine, but some people have real, often medical, reasons to gain weight.
      Smoothies are versatile enough to be used to lose weight, maintain weight, and even gain weight. With the right
      recipe, with thoughtful planning, and with carefully-chosen healthful ingredients you can use smoothies as a
      route to steady weight gain.
      <br>
      There are a lot of valid reasons to gain weight. For some people it may be a sport or for the sake of appearance.
      Maybe you’re naturally thin and lack muscle tone. There is nothing wrong with wanting to bulk up a little so that
      you fill out, are stronger, and can compete in certain types of sports that interest you or perform better in
      athletics in which you already participate.
      <br>
      Some people need to gain weight for medical reasons. If you have been sick or hospitalized for a long time, you
      may need to put weight back on. You may also have a medical condition, such as hyperthyroidism, that makes you
      lose weight unintentionally. Other conditions can cause you to lose your appetite, which in turn causes you to
      lose weight because you have no interest in eating. Cancer, liver disease, heart failure, HIV, kidney failure,
      and certain medications all can cause reduced appetite.

    <h3  style="text-align:left">1-The Healthy Way to Gain Weight:</h3><img src="Home-Remedies-to-Gain-Weight-Fast-n-easy-way.jpg"
      alt="Responsive image" class="img-fluid" style="float:left;width:40%">
    <p style="font-size:130%;text-align:left;">
      It can be tempting to use the need to gain wait as an excuse to eat anything and everything that tempts you, but
      there is a right way and a wrong way to put on extra pounds. Eating junk foods and those rich in unhealthy fats
      and added sugars will help you gain weight, but not in a healthful way. You need to eat foods that are
      calorie-dense, but also nutrient-dense.
      <br>
      Avoid foods that are high in empty calories, like deep fried foods, sugary snacks, and processed snacks. Eat
      healthful foods in greater quantities. Supplement your normal foods with healthful, high-calorie snacks like nuts
      and seeds, dried fruits, avocado, full-fat yogurt, and whole grains.
      <br>
      If you are gaining weight for medical reasons, start with your doctor’s advice, or that of a nutritionist or
      dietician. Find out how many calories you should consume every day and start counting them. The more calories you
      consume, the more weight you will put on.
      <br>
      If you are gaining weight to put on more muscle mass or to perform better at athletics, you need to be especially
      conscious of eating more protein. As you boost your calorie intake add dairy products, nuts, seeds, eggs, and
      other protein-rich foods.

    <h3  style="text-align:left">2-Ingredients for Weight Gain:</h3>
    <p style="font-size:135%;text-align:left;text-decoration: underline">Smoothies are a perfect dietary addition if you need to
      gain weight. If you have no appetite, or if you have
      digestive problems due to a medical condition, a smoothie will be easier to handle than whole foods. Even if you
      don’t have a problem with eating more, a smoothie is still a great way to get more calories into your diet every
      day. Here are some ingredients to start stocking up on for your high-calorie smoothies:</p>
    <div style="text-align:left;font-size:130%">
      <div class="imgs">
        <img class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image" style="height:200px;width:300px" src="nut-butter-lifestyle.jpg" >
        <img class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image" style="height:200px;width:300px" src="64014530 (1).jpg" >
      </div>
      <b>Nuts and nut butters:</b>The healthy fats found in nuts are nutritious and high in calories. Just one
      tablespoon
      of nut butter has between 90 and 110 calories. Put whole nuts into your smoothie and blend them in, or use
      natural
      nut butters, including peanut butter, almond butter, cashew butter, or even sunflower seed butter.
      <br><b>Seeds:</b> Seeds, like nuts, are rich in healthy fats and high in calories. You can add a number of seeds
      to
      your smoothie without adding much flavor. They can also provide extra nutrients. Flax seeds, chia seeds, and hemp
      seeds are all good choices and will add protein, fat and calories. If you use flax seeds, be sure to grind them
      up in a food processor first.
      <div class="imgs">
        <img class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image" style="height:200px;width:300px" src="avocado.jpg" >
        <img class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image" style="height:200px;width:300px" src="bottles-with-fresh-coconut-oil-table-wooden_33562036-a8ab-11e8-8937-8a80aaa2408c.jpg" >
      </div>
      <br><b>Avocado:</b>Avocados are also rich in healthy unsaturated fats that include a lot of calories. They are
      also
      great in smoothies because they give any recipe a smooth and creamy texture. The flavor of fresh avocado is mild
      and unobtrusive. It blends well into any type of smoothie recipe.
      <br><b>Coconut oil:</b>The oil made from coconuts is almost entirely made up of fats, which are calorie-dense.
      Coconut oil is also a potent superfood. It helps to lower bad cholesterol levels while raising good cholesterol.
      It has antibiotic properties, and it may even protect against developing Alzheimer’s disease. Maybe best of all,
      coconut oil tastes great, especially in fruity or chocolaty smoothies. Make sure you look for virgin coconut oil.

      </div>
      <br><b>Dried fruits:</b>You might normally reach for fresh fruits for nutritional reasons, but if you want more
      calories per ounce in your smoothie, go with dried fruits. Dried fruits are high in natural fruit sugars and in
      calories. Fresh and frozen fruits contain water, which contributes no calories to your smoothies. Make sure you
      pick dried fruits that have no added, refined sugar.
      <br><b>Oats:</b> Carbohydrates from whole grains are high in calories and fiber as well as vitamins and minerals.
      Oats are a good choice for smoothies because they blend well. Put raw oats into the blender first to chop them
      up, then add the rest of your smoothie ingredients.
      <div class="imgs">
        <img class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image" style="height:200px;width:300px" src="parents-take-note-milk-and-dairy-products-do-not-promote-childhood-obesity.jpg" >

      </div>
      <br><b>Milk and Yogurt:</b>Unless you have a lactose intolerance, full-fat dairy products are great for adding
      weight
      because they are rich in fat and protein. Raw milk has historically been used to pack on the pounds. If you don’t
      have access to raw milk, opt for whole milk. Yogurt, again full-fat varieties, blend well in most smoothies and
      are high in good calories.
      <br><b>Protein Powders:</b>Protein supplements and gelatin are an easy way to boost the amount of protein in your
      smoothies
      <p>Remember that your goal, in addition to putting on pounds, should be to eat nutritious and healthful foods.
        Avoid processed foods and those that are high in calories simply because of added sugar.
        <br>
        If you’re wondering about raw eggs, a classic staple of old-school bodybuilding, I don’t feel comfortable
        recommending them. The risks of salmonella contamination are too great. However, if you have access to eggs
        from local, pastured chickens, I don’t see a problem.</p>

    <p style="font-size:130%;text-align: left;font-weight:600">Smoothies are great vehicles for bulking up on calories
      because you can more easily drink your extra food intake
